To synchronize PyCharm with GitHub, you need to perform a few steps to connect your PyCharm project with a GitHub repository. Here's a general guide:

### 1. Install Git:
   Make sure Git is installed on your machine. You can download it from [Git Downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

### 2. Create a GitHub Repository:
   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/).
   - Log in to your account.
   - Create a new repository.

### 3. Open Your PyCharm Project:
   Open your PyCharm project that you want to synchronize with GitHub.

### 4. Initialize a Git Repository in PyCharm:
   - Go to "VCS" in the top menu.
   - Select "Enable Version Control Integration."
   - Choose "Git" from the dropdown.
   - Click "OK."

### 5. Commit Changes:
   - In PyCharm, go to the "Commit" tool window (usually on the bottom of the screen).
   - Add files you want to commit.
   - Enter a commit message.
   - Click "Commit."

### 6. Add GitHub Remote:
   - Go to "VCS" in the top menu.
   - Select "Git" -> "Remotes" -> "Add."
   - Enter the URL of your GitHub repository.
   - Click "OK."

### 7. Push Changes to GitHub:
   - Go to "VCS" in the top menu.
   - Select "Git" -> "Push."
   - Choose the remote you added (GitHub).
   - Click "Push."

### 8. Pull Changes from GitHub (Optional):
   If you're working in a team or from multiple machines, you might want to pull changes before pushing your own. You can do this through the "VCS" menu.

### 9. Configure PyCharm to Remember GitHub Credentials:
   - Go to "File" -> "Settings" -> "Version Control" -> "Git."
   - Check "Remember credentials."

Now, your PyCharm project is synchronized with your GitHub repository. You can continue committing and pushing changes using PyCharm's Git integration.
